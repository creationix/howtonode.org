I devised a viable solution, but I couldnâ€™t figure out an effective way to parse the input. The format was painfully simple: text piped via stdin. No problem, right? I burned over half my time on what should have been a minor detail, and I ended up with a fragile, zip-tie and duct tape hack that still makes me shudder.</p>

<p>The experience inspired me to find an idiomatic approach to programming challenges. After working through more problems, I arrived at a pattern I hope others will find useful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Daddy, what's a stream?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I explained that a stream is like a line of water along the ground.  If you dig a trench on a hill and fill up the high end using a water hose the water will run down the hill along the trench.  This is one of his favorite hobbies in the back yard, so he understood completely.  I explained that when new water is added to the top, it eventually makes its way to the bottom of the stream.  The end where water comes from is called the <strong>upstream</strong> and the other end is the <strong>downstream</strong>.  Gravity pulls water down.</p>

Express) and I did what anyone else would do - I googled it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately all the articles / posts out there are either outdated, too complex or plain wrong. So I did the next
most obvious thing - post a question on the mailing list. As always Mr. Holowaychuk was incredibly quick to respond.
His answer lead me to do what I should have done in the first place - read the docs.</p>

Let's take a look at what <code>process.nextTick()</code> does, and when to use it.</p>

<p>As you might already know, every Node application runs on a single thread. What this means is that <strong>apart from I/O</strong> - at any time, only one task/event is processed by Node's event loop. You can imagine this event loop to be a queue of callbacks that are processed by Node on every <strong>tick</strong> of the event loop. So, even if you are running Node on a multi-core machine, you will not get any parallelism in terms of actual processing - all events will be processed only one at a time. This is why Node is a great fit for I/O bound tasks, and definitely not for CPU intensive tasks. For every I/O bound task, you can simply define a callback that will get added to the event queue. The callback will fire when the I/O operation is done, and in the mean time, the application can continue to process other I/O bound requests. </p>

<p>Given this model, what <code>process.nextTick()</code> actually does is defer the execution of an action till the next pass around the event loop. Let's take a simple example. If we had a function <code>foo()</code> which we wanted to invoke in the next tick, this is how we do it:</p>

<pre><code><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> foo</span><span class="pun">()</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; console</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">error</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">'foo'</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br /></span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br /><br />process</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">nextTick</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">foo</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br />console</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">error</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">'bar'</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br /></span></code></pre>

<p>If you ran the above snippet, you will notice that <code>bar</code> will be printed in your console before <code>foo</code>, as we have delayed the invokation of <code>foo()</code> till the next tick of the event loop:</p>

<pre><code><span class="pln">bar<br />foo<br /></span></code></pre>

<p>In fact, you can get the same result by using <code>setTimeout()</code> this way:</p>

<pre><code><span class="pln">setTimeout</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">foo</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br />console</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">'bar'</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br /></span></code></pre>

<p>However, <code>process.nextTick()</code> is not just a simple alias to <code>setTimeout(fn, 0)</code> - it's <a href="https://gist.github.com/1257394">far more efficient</a>.</p>

<p>More precisely, <code>process.nextTick()</code> defers the function until a completely new stack.  You can call as many functions as you want in the current stack.  The function that called nextTick has to return, as well as its parent, all the way up to the root of the stack.  Then when the event loop is looking for a new event to execute, your <code>nextTick</code>'ed function will be there in the event queue and execute on a whole new stack.</p>

<p>Let's see where we can use <code>process.nextTick()</code>:</p>
