I'm a Principal Sales Engineer with MarkLogic in the UK. Big NoSQL geek, but
not a mindless fanboi! Author of the upcoming 'NoSQL for Dummies' book from Wiley.

Also love Node.js, particularly for real time situational awareness application stacks
where timely information is a must. Love Node.js packages to run http servers,
supporting WebSockets on HTML5 apps, and linking to IM platforms like Jabber.

I'm the creator of MLJS and MLDotNet, wrappers in JavaScript and .NET, respectively,
for the MarkLogic REST API.
