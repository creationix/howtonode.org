I presently work as CTO at CloudRail. We provide a collection of SDKs that makes it easy for developers to integrate a multitude of cloud APIs. In my free time, I like to run and go skiing.

Many developers struggle with integrating APIs into their apps since there's so many formats and standards and not every provider sticks to them. I work to make that less of a pain.
