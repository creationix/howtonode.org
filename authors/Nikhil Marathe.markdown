I am a second year ( sophomore ) student at DA-IICT Gandhinagar in India. Currently I contribute to [KDE](http://www.kde.org) besides experimenting with *lots* of different languages and open source technologies. At this point I haven't decided what area of computers I am really interested in and so I work at all levels, from system calls to web applications.

I spend the rest of the day playing football, reading and enjoying college life. Willing to work for food :).
