I've started programming at age 12, even before owning a computer. My first computer was a ZX-Spectrum. I've programmed
from Z80 assembly and x86 assembly years ago to .NET and node.js today, with everything in between.
I own a company which provides services to country governments and large organizations in Argentina, also I'm on the board
of Prosart Development Studio, also located in Argentina, specialized in tackling challenging projects.
