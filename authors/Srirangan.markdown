I'm a passionate programmer and product developer. I've been programming professionally since 2002 and I bring expertise in both front-end and back-end development.

In the last ten years, I've successfully executed freelance, open source and enterprise projects. I have been part of cross-functional and cross-cultural teams and I've had the opportunity to [work](http://www.linkedin.com/in/srirangan) with some very interesting people and companies.

I enjoy building browser based, real-time apps using innovative technologies including Node.js, Socket.io, Express.js, HTML5, JQuery, SugarJS, CSS3 etc.

Enterprise technologies that interest me are primarily Python and Scala. I've been working with NoSQL databases â€” MongoDB and Google Data Store APIs in particular.

Other technologies that I've had fun with over the years are Adobe Flex, Java (Spring, Hibernate and popular enterprise frameworks), PHP 5 and related platforms, frameworks and libraries.

I'm the creator of [Review19](http://www.review19.com) - next generation, real-time collaboration.

I'm a keen open-source enthusiast and my [GitHub](https://github.com/Srirangan) profile contains contributions to various Node.js, Scala, Python and Adobe Flex projects.

I'm the author of the [Apache Maven 3 Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/apache-maven-3-0-cookbook/book) (Packt Publishing, ISBN 978-1-849512-442) which is available for purchase in stores and on Barnes and Nobles, Amazon and Flipkart.
