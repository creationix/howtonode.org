# HowToNode.org

This is a community supported blog about how to program in nodejs.

This is powered by a new static blog engine written in node called [wheat][].

To run a local version of the blog, simply install [wheat][] and it's dependencies, node.JS v0.1.101 or later.

If you have [spark][] installed, just type `spark` in this directory.  If not, append `.listen(3000)` right before the closing semicolon and run it with `node app.js`

You can get a working wheat environment out of the box with [ivy][].

    I had so much fun writing the last article on control flow, that I decided to...

    ## First section: Display JavaScript files

    * display contents of external JavaScript file (path is relative to .markdown file)
    <test-code/test-file.js>

    * display contents of external JavaScript file and evaluate its contents
    <test-code/evaluate-file.js*>

    More content goes here.
