Title: Node.js and MongoDB

Node: v0.2.1

This was the sixth in a series of posts leading up to
[Node.js Knockout][] on how to use [node.js][]. This post was
written by [10gen][] and [is cross-posted from their blog][].

[10gen][1] is the corporate sponsor of [MongoDB][]. MongoDB bridges
the gap between key-value stores (which are fast and highly
scalable) and traditional RDBMS systems (which provide rich queries
and deep functionality).

## Node and MongoDB

Node.js is turning out to be a framework of choice for building
real-time applications of all kinds, from analytics systems to chat
servers to location-based tracking services. If you’re still new to
Node, check out [Simon Willison’s excellent introductory post][].
If you’re already using Node, you probably need a database, and you
just might have considered using MongoDB.

The rationale is certainly there. Working with Node’s JavaScript
means that MongoDB documents get their most natural representation—as JSON—right in the application layer. There’s also
significant continuity between your application and the MongoDB
shell, since the shell is essentially a JavaScript interpreter, so
you don’t have to change languages when moving from application to
database.

## Node.js MongodB Driver

Especially impressive to us at 10gen has been the community support
for Node.js and MongoDB. First, there’s Christian Kvalheim’s
excellent [mongodb-node-native project][], a non-blocking MongoDB
driver implemented entirely in JavaScript using Node.js’s system
libraries. The project is a pretty close port of the
[MongoDB Ruby driver][], making for an easy transition for those
already used to the 10gen-supported drivers. If you’re just
starting, there’s a helpful [mongodb-node-native mailing list][].

## Hummingbird

Need a real-world example? Check out [Hummingbird][], Michael
Nutt’s real-time analytics app. It’s built on top of MongoDB using
Node.js and the mongodb-node-native driver. Hummingbird, which is
used in production at [Gilt Groupe][], brings together an
impressive array of technologies; it uses the [express.js][]
Node.js app framework and sports a responsive interface with the
help of web sockets. Definitely worth checking out.

## Mongoose

Of course, one of the admitted difficulties in working with Node.js
is dealing with deep callback structures. If this poses a problem,
or if you happen to want a richer data modeling library, then
[Mongoose][] is the answer. Created by [Learnboost][], Mongoose
sits atop mongodb-node-native, providing a nice API for modeling
your application.
